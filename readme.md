Right now, I've just got content packs up for [Farm Type Manager](https://github.com/Esca-MMC/FarmTypeManager)

Forage on the Farm is a work in progress.

More Dig Spots and Litter work on the vanilla maps, excluding Ginger Island, and don't have any special zones worked out for the Farm map, so as long as FTM plays nice with your custom farm map, these content packs should, too. 

More Dig Spots has an 80% chance of spawning Artifact dig spots and a 20% chance for making a Seed Spot with each of the dig spots spawned each day. 

Litter adds a chance to spawn a small number of fishing trash items as foragables around each of the maps, for folks who like to use the Recycle machine.
