Right now, the content packs I'm claiming are just for [Farm Type Manager](https://github.com/Esca-MMC/FarmTypeManager) I did make some edits to [Cleaner Farm Buildings](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13664) by Oakstar519, who kindly gave permission for me to post the edits here. It is not my original work, and Oakstar519 is more than welcome to incorporate any and all of the edits I made as they see fit. Details of edits are below.

Forage on the Farm is a work in progress.

More Dig Spots and Litter work on the vanilla maps, excluding Ginger Island, and don't have any special zones worked out for the Farm map, so as long as FTM plays nice with your custom farm map, these content packs should, too. 

More Dig Spots has an 80% chance of spawning Artifact dig spots and a 20% chance for making a Seed Spot with each of the dig spots spawned each day. 

Litter adds a chance to spawn a small number of fishing trash items as foragables around each of the maps, for folks who like to use the Recycle machine. 

Cleaner Farm Buildings, Edited: maps are all the same. I added the ability to toggle which maps get loaded as a config option, an i18t folder and a default.json for the i18t folder so the config menu Content Patcher generates would be more self explanitory. To further that, I did rename the map files, because otherwise the options for them would be stuck as numeric sliders instead of a drop down list.
