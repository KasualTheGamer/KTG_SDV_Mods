These are translations for the GMCM config menu for Kana's [Green Farm Cave](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19498). English was done by a native speaker, and the remaining translations were done using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
To use, take the folder labeled `i18n` in this directory with at least the `default.json` file and place it at the same level as the `assets` folder under Kana's mod.

The directory should look like:

```
Grotta
-[CP] MiaGrotta
--assets
--i18n
-[FTM] Grotta
```
